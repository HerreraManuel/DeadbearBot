# DeadbearBot
A [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) server management bot, inspired by [NadekoBot](https://nadekobot.me/) and written in Python (version 3.5.3+) using the [discord.py module](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## How do I use it?
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements from requirements.txt
3. Run the main.py script in a terminal
4. Enter your bot's secret token

## What's it do?
Currently, DeadbearBot can:
* Say things in nicely formatted embeds, which can be edited later
* Track user profiles and allow users to customize with personal info
* Track user xp and levels as part of their profile
* "Star" messages in a channel, preserving them even if they are modified or deleted later
* Assign or unassign a role
* Automatically assign a role to users when joining your server
* Set a configurable greeting and/or leave message to be sent when users join or leave your server
* Automatically assign a role to a user when connecting to a voice channel
* Allow users to assign roles to themselves by clicking emoji reactions
* Set a configurable alert message to be sent when users gain or lose a role

## What's planned for the future?
The current todo list includes:
* Make the bot programmatically log certain events in a server to a specified channel
* Add mute/kick/ban functions to the bot
* A configurable permission system that allows enabling/disabling commands for users, roles, or channels
* A currency system that allows buying things in a configurable shop
* A raffling system that allows submitting steam keys to the bot to be raffled out to users or bought with currency
* Some kind of image manipulation system a-la the defunct NotSoBot?
* A deployment system that allows the bot to be easily set up with no fuss (docker maybe?)
* A hosted version of the bot that can simply be invited to a server, no host computer required
* Other fun things...

## Why are you rewriting bot functionality that already exists?
