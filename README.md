# DeadbearBot
A [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) server management bot, inspired by [NadekoBot](https://nadekobot.me/) and written in Python (version 3+) using the [discord.py module](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## What's it do?
Currently, DeadbearBot can:
* Assign or unassign a role to yourself
* Automatically assign a role to users when joining your server
* Allow users to assign roles to themselves by clicking a fully configurable emoji reaction
* Automatically assign a role to a user when connecting to a voice channel
* Set a configurable greeting and/or leave message to be sent when users join or leave your server
* Send a list of all channels/roles/emojis on the server

## What's planned for the future?
The current todo list includes:
* Make the bot say things in nicely formatted messages
* Assign a role to anyone via command
* Assign multiple roles to users when joining the server
* Allow greeting/leave messages to be sent at a channel level
* A configurable permission system that allows enabling/disabling commands for users, roles, or channels
* An experience or reputation system of some kind that tracks user data
* A currency system that allows buying things in a configurable shop
* A raffling system that allows submitting steam keys to the bot to be raffled out to users or bought with currency
* Some kind of image manipulation system a-la the defunct NotSoBot?
* Other fun things...

## Why are you rewriting bot functionality that already exists?
